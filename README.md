# OKR-Tree

At Investec we had OKRs in an excel spreadsheet and dit was hard to see top level OKRs, team OKRs, individual OKRs etc.
What I want is a tree structure where you can add OKRs and assign it to teams or users.
All OKRs can be public or private, you can just see the team / User name if it's private
Everyone in a team can see team OKRs and add private and public comments
Everyone can add their own OKRs.

Optional
  Your manager should approve your OKR before it's added.

You should be able to view % wise how your OKRs are doing. A Team's OKR can be complete but individual OKRs below or next to it doesn't need to be completed.

We want to see some stats. Team stats, Individual stats, Tree stats.

## Top level OKRs
## Assign to Teams / Users

Completed, Not Completed, Failed
Percentages in tree about Completed, Not Completed, Failed
Public Notes
Private Notes
Manager approval
Due date auto fails OKRs.
Very easy to edit OKRs and Due dates, it shouldn't be easy management.
